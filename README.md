# Height-prediction-using-Linear-Regression
#Overview
This project involves building a simple linear regression model to predict a person's height based on their weight. The model uses historical data on weight and height to learn the relationship between these two variables and make predictions for new data.

Project Description
The goal of this project is to develop a linear regression model that predicts height based on weight. Linear regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this case, the dependent variable is height, and the independent variable is weight.

Data
The dataset used for training the model consists of records of weights and corresponding heights. The data is stored in a CSV file named height-weight.csv.

Data Columns
Weight (kg): The weight of the individual.
Height (cm): The height of the individual.
Sample Data
Weight (kg)	Height (cm)
60	160
70	170
80	180
...	...
Requirements
To run the model, you'll need the following Python libraries:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib (for visualization)

You can install the required packages using pip:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Prepare the Data: Make sure the height-weight.csv file is in the same directory as the script.

Run the Model: Execute the height_prediction.py script to train the model and make predictions.

bash
Copy code
python height_prediction.py
Input Weight: The script will prompt you to enter a weight for which you want to predict the height.

View Results: The predicted height will be displayed on the console.


Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric. A lower MSE indicates better performance. You can visualize the results using the plot generated by the script, which shows the actual data points and the regression line.
